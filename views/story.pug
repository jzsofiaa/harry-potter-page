                | There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.
                | In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across.
                | However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and
                | made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their
                | path blocked by a hooded figure.
                p
                    | And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims,
                    | for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate
                    | the three brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever
                    | enough to evade him.
                p
                    | So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence:
                    | a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death!
                    | So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there,
                    | and gave it to the oldest brother.
                    br
                    |      Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further,
                    |      and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave
                    |      it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.
                p
                    | And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest
                    | and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him
                    | to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And death, most unwillingly, handed over his own
                    | Cloak of Invisibility.
                p
                    | Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of
                    | the adventure they had had, and admiring Death&rsquo;s gifts. In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.
                p
                    | The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel.
                    | Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor,
                    | the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how
                    | it made him invincible.
                p
                    | That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed.
                    | The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother&rsquo;s throat.
                p And so Death took the first brother for his own.
                p
                    | Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power
                    | to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry,
                    | before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.
                    br
                    | Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil.
                    |      Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother,
                    |      driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her.
                p And so Death took the second brother for his own.
                p
                    | But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he
                    | had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son.
                    | And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.
